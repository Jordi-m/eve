DESCRIPTION

What is a software agent? 

A computer program with: "an agreement to act on one's behalf" (Wikipedia)

Properties of an agent:

- An agent is autonomous. 
- An agent can communicate with other agents and/or humans.
- An agent has memory to store its state and history, his view of the world.
- An agent is interactive: it can take initiative to perform some task.
- An agent is reactive: it can respond to other agents or humans.
- An agent has a goal, a purpose which the agent aims to fullfill.

To support these properties, an Eve agent consists of:

- Code containing the agents logic. This allows an agent to perform its tasks,
  take initiative, learn, react, cooperate, negotiate, etcetera.
- Communication facilities allowing the agent to interact with other agents.
  Eve supports multiple transport layers (currently over HTTP and XMPP), 
  allowing agents to reach each other in various ways.
- Clock, enabling the agent to schedule tasks for itself.
- Memory, a place where the agent can store its state and history.
