# Introduction

Eve has a library available in JavaScript, running on Node.js.
This library provides a ready-made Node.js server and some example agents.
Node.js runs Javascript, which is a very natural language to handle
JSON-RPC messages, as JSON is a subset of the Javascript language.

The JavaScript library is in a prototypal phase and is not yet suitable
to use in production.


## Downloads {#downloads}

All available libraries can be downloaded on the
[downloads page](downloads.html).


## Getting Started {#gettingstarted}

The page [Getting Started](gettingstarted.html) gives a detailed tutorial
on how to set up Eve running on Node.js.
